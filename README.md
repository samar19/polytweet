# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat compile 
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
npx hardhat verify --network mumbai 0xa7D09AEBa4E4fEAd991F055Fd987E932858e40e6
